        <p class="about-bodycopy fade-in">

            The Kitten Inn is a registered not for profit charitable trust based in Kelson, Lower Hutt.

        </p>

        <p class="about-bodycopy fade-in">

            We take in unwanted pregnant cats, and kittens from throughout the Wellington region. We also regularly run
            discounted desexing programs to encourage and help people to responsibly desex their cats.

        </p>

        <h1 class="about-subhead fade-in">Our Mission</h1>

        <ul class="about-bodycopy about-list fade-in">

            <li> To promote the responsible desexing of cats</li>
            <li>Provide sanctuary and care for pregnant cats and kittens</li>
            <li>Find loving new homes for the kittens and cats when they are ready for adoption</li>

        </ul>


        <h1 class="about-subhead fade-in">What we do</h1>

        <p class="about-bodycopy fade-in">

            We generally have kittens (and sometimes the mother cats once they’ve been spayed) available for adoption
            almost
            all year round.

        </p>

        <p class="about-bodycopy fade-in">

            Our kittens are vacationing at the Kitten Inn while they await collection for their forever homes. During
            their
            stay they have become very social and have learnt the ways of the litter-box.
        </p>

        <p class="about-bodycopy fade-in">

            The Inn Keeper has kindly had them all desexed and vaccinated, microchipped, registered and regularly
            treated
            for worms and fleas. There is also a free insurance cover that extends for 30 days!

        </p>

        <h1 class="about-subhead fade-in">Who we are</h1>

        <p class="about-bodycopy fade-in">

            There are six trustees involved in the running and day-to-day caring for the cats and kittens. These ladies
            work
            tirelessly along side the volunteers to make sure everything runs smoothly. They all have a great team of
            wonderful helpers – loyal, honest people. These are the volunteers that make any organisation such a
            success.

        </p>

        <p class="about-bodycopy  fade-in">

            At Kitten Inn, we have no paid staff – they all donate their time and we thank them for that.

        </p>
