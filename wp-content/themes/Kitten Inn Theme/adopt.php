                When you adopt a pet you’re expanding your family, which is why they’re often referred to
                as “fur babies”! It’s a big responsibility and should be a well thought out decision. Your home will be
                your
                pet’s forever home – once you adopt them, you are their family and there’s no going back. Pets are
                family,
                not
                possessions that can be traded. If you’re ready to adopt a cat or kitten from us, that’s wonderful! Here
                are
                a
                few things you should know.

                We need to charge a donation for each of our kittens to help cover costs and make sure that we can
                continue
                to
                care for all the unwanted pregnant cats and kittens that come in and us. We are a registered

                time.
                There are no paid staff members, so the money you donate when you adopt a kitten only covers the costs
                listed
